# AngularJS Playground

A great way to introduce Angular is to have it hands-on. This is what this tutorial is all about. Playing with Angular.

We will go step-by-step exploring the concepts on Angular and build a simple application, including writing and running unit and end-to-end tests.

## Get started

You will need to install:

### [git](http://git-scm.com/download)
This will allow you to checkout the project:

```
> git checkout https://github.com/ferreiratiago/angular-playground.git
> cd angular-playground/
```

### [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Node will allow you to run [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) in order to install your project dependencies:

```
> npm install
```

## step-0 - bootstrapping

Resets your workspace to `step-0`:
```
> git checkout -f step-0
```

To see if the app is running in the browser open a separate terminal and run:
```
> npm start
```

This will start a web service and run you application at [`http://localhost:8000/app/`](http://localhost:8000/app/).
